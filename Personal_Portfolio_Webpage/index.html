    <h1>Early life</h1>
    <p> Ronnie James "Dio" Padavona was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Italian-American parents[4] Patrick and
      Anna from Cortland, New York. His family moved to Portsmouth from Cortland as part of his father's service in the
      U.S. Army during World War II,[14] and they resided there for only a short time before returning to Cortland.
      Padavona listened to a great deal of opera while growing up and was influenced vocally by American tenor Mario
      Lanza.[15] His first formal musical training began at age 5, learning to play the trumpet.[15] Padavona
      participated in his high school's band program and was one of the youngest members selected to play in the
      school's official dance band.[citation needed] It was also during high school that Padavona formed his first rock
      'n' roll group, The Vegas Kings,[16] which would later be named Ronnie and the Rumblers and then Ronnie and the
      Red Caps. Though Padavona began his rock 'n' roll career on trumpet, he added singing to his skill set and also
      assumed bass guitar duties for the groups.[citation needed]

      Padavona graduated from Cortland High School in 1960.[16] He was allegedly offered a scholarship to the
      prestigious Juilliard School of Music but did not take up the offer due to his interest in rock music.[17] He
      instead attended the University at Buffalo to major in pharmacology.[18] There, he played trumpet in the
      university's concert band; however, he only attended the university from 1960 to 1961 and did not graduate.[14]
      Then he enrolled at Cortland State College but dropped out as well.[19] In a 2000 interview, he stated that he
      majored in history and minored in English.[20]

      Despite being known for his powerful singing voice, Padavona claimed to have never received any vocal
      training.[21] He instead attributed his singing ability to the use of breathing techniques he learned while
      playing trumpet.</p>

    <h1>Personal life</h1>
    <p>Dio married his first wife Loretta Berardi (born 1941) in 1963.[1] They adopted a son but divorced in 1972.[14]

      In 1978, Dio married Wendy Walters[2] (born 1945), ex-wife of drummer Aynsley Dunbar[36] and guitarist Ricardo
      Gaxiola.[37][38] She also served as Dio's manager. In the 1980s, she managed the Los Angeles rock bands Rough
      Cutt, NuHaven, Cold Sweat and Hellion. The couple separated but did not divorce. (In 2012, after Dio's death, she
      married her longtime partner Omar Gimenez.[39])

      In September 2003, Dio accidentally severed his thumb during a gardening accident when a heavy garden gnome fell
      onto it.[40] Dio was concerned he would no longer be able to do his signature "devil's horns" hand gesture, but a
      doctor managed to re-attach it.[41] </p>

    <h1>Black Sabbath</h1>
    <p>Following his departure from Rainbow in 1979, Dio joined Black Sabbath, replacing the fired Ozzy Osbourne. Dio
      met Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi by chance at the Rainbow on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in 1979.[25] The two
      musicians were in similar situations, as Dio was seeking a new project and Iommi needed a vocalist. Dio said of
      the encounter, "It must have been fate, because we connected so instantly."[25] The pair kept in touch until Dio
      arrived at Iommi's Los Angeles house for a relaxed, getting-to-know-you jam session. On that first day, the duo
      wrote the song "Children of the Sea," which appeared on the Heaven and Hell album, the first the band recorded
      with Dio as its vocalist, released in 1980.

      The follow-up album, Mob Rules (1981), featured new drummer Vinny Appice. Personality conflicts began emerging
      within the band. "Ronnie came into the band and he was doing whatever we told him, basically because he wanted the
      gig. The next album was a little different," Iommi recalled.[25] In 1982, conflict arose over the mixing of the
      Live Evil album. Iommi asserted that the album's engineer began complaining to him that he would work all day long
      on a mix, only to have Dio return to the studio at night to "do his own mix" in which his vocals were more
      prominent.[25] This was denied by Dio.[26] The conflict led to Dio and Appice ultimately quitting the band later
      that year.

      In 1991, Dio returned to Black Sabbath to record the Dehumanizer album. The album was a minor hit, reaching the
      Top 40 in the United Kingdom and #44 on the US Billboard 200. The single "Time Machine" was featured in the movie
      Wayne's World, the tenth highest-grossing film of 1992. Close to the end of 1992, Dio and Appice again left the
      band, citing an inability to work with Iommi and Butler.</p>
